A man riding on a bike can travel 1 mile in 3 minutes if the wind blows in the direction he is moving and in 4 minutes if it is against him. How fast can the man travel 1 mile if there is no wind?

SOLUTION

let 洧논 be the (in miles/min) that the wind blows and r be the rate (in miles/min) that the man bikes at.

With wind we know the speed is 
洧논 + r = 1/3

And with wind against we know the speed is (as the strength of the wind is acting against the rider)
r - 洧논 = 1/4

Using simultaneous equations we get
r = 7/24 and 洧논 = 1/3

as with no wind we only care about the rider velocity we can do 
t = d/r  -> 1/(7/24) = **24/7 miles**
