1. **Calculate the position of the minute hand:**
   - At 15 minutes past the hour, the minute hand is at the 3 on the clock.
   - Each minute represents 6 degrees (since \(360^\circ / 60 = 6^\circ\)).
   - Therefore, the minute hand at 15 minutes is at \(15 \times 6 = 90^\circ\).

2. **Calculate the position of the hour hand:**
   - The hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour (since 360 / 12 = 30).
   - At 3:00, the hour hand is at (3 * 30 = 90).
   - In addition, the hour hand moves as the minutes progress. In 15 minutes, it moves 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 (since it moves 0.5 degrees per minute).
   - Therefore, at 3:15, the hour hand is at 90 + 7.5 = 97.5.

3. **Calculate the angle between the two hands:**
   - The absolute difference between the positions of the hour hand and the minute hand is |97.5 - 90| = 7.5.

Thus, the angle between the hands of a clock at 3:15 PM is **7.5 degrees**.
