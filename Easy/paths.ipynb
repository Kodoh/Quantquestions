Your character starts at $(0,0)$ and can only move up and right. How many possible paths can your character take to get to $(6,6)$?\n\n### Steps to Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Total Moves Required**:\n   - Moving from $(0,0)$ to $(6,6)$ involves 6 moves to the right and 6 moves up.\n   - This means a total of 12 moves (6 rights and 6 ups).\n\n2. **Use Combinatorics**:\n   - The problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 6 rights (R) and 6 ups (U) in a sequence of 12 moves.\n   - The number of such sequences is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{12}{6}$ (or equivalently $\\binom{12}{6}$).\n\n3. **Calculate the Binomial Coefficient**:\n   $$\n   \\binom{12}{6} = \\frac{12!}{6! \\cdot 6!}\n   $$\n\n### Calculation\n\nFirst, compute the factorial values:\n$$\n12! = 479,001,600\n$$\n$$\n6! = 720\n$$\n\nThen, use these values to calculate the binomial coefficient:\n$$\n\\binom{12}{6} = \\frac{12!}{6! \\cdot 6!} = \\frac{479,001,600}{720 \\times 720}\n$$\n$$\n\\binom{12}{6} = \\frac{479,001,600}{518,400} = 924\n$$\n\nThus, the number of possible paths from $(0,0)$ to $(6,6)$ is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{924}\n$$\n",
